1.What is npm?
-> npm is package manager, its a library and registry for Javascript software packages

2.What is Parcel/Webpack? Why do we need it?
-> Parcel or Webpack is bundler which will minify, clean or compact your code,
so that receiving from requesting to server becomes easier,
whithout using bundler which might take you to do multiple file transfer
to load a page of your application.

3.What is parcel-cache?
->parcel-cache is cache created by parcel when it builds our application,
it stores information about our application,
when it rebuilds it doesnt have to re-parse or re-analyze everything,
so parcel is so fast in development mode.

4.What is npx?
->Its an npm package runner which will be installed along with npm if you installed npm above 5.2.0,
It can execute any package from npm registry without even installing that package.

5.What is difference between dependencies vs devDependencies?
->dependencies are packages required by our application for production
devDependencies are the packages required by our application for development and testing locally.

6.What is Tree Shaking?
->In production build, parcel analyzes the imports and exports of the modules and removes everything
that is not used, this called "tree shaking" or "dead code elimination"

7.What is Hot Module Replacement?
->HMR updates the modules in the browser at runtime without needing a whole page refresh.
This means application state can be retained as you change small things in your code.

8.List down your favourite 5 superpowers of Parcel and describe any 3 of them in your own words
->Hot Module Replacement, File Watcher Algorithm, Image Optimization, Cleaning our code, Caching while development
i)File watcher algorithm: Parcel uses a very fast watcher written in C++ that integrates
with file watching of operating system, using which Parcel watches every file in project root.
Baed on events and metadata from these files Parcel determines which files need to be rebuilt.
ii)Caching: Parcel caches everything it builds to disk.
On restarting the server, Parcel will build only those files which has changed since last time it ran.
By-default parcel stores its cache in .parcel-cache folder inside your project. 
You should add this to gitignore.
iii)Parcel does lossless image optimization for JPEGs adn PNGs by default in production mode,
which reduces the size of images without affecting their quality.
This does not require any query parameters or configuration to use.

9.What is gitignore?What should we add and not add into it?
->gitignore is file that specifies intentionally untracked files that Git should ignore.
We should add, all those files which can be generated on the server, into this file.

10.What is the difference between package.json and package-lock.json?
->package.json: specifies the minimum version of packages your application needs, if you update the version of any package 
the isnt reflected here
package-lock.json: records exact version of each installed package which allows you to reinstall them.
Ref: https://medium.com/dlt-labs-publication/package-json-vs-package-lock-json-c8d5deba12cb

11.Why should I not modify package-lock.json?
->package-lock.json file contains the exact version of pacakages required for our project,
modifying it might result in varied result from the time when we developed(unexpected or undesirable result).
So its recommended not to mofidy it.

12.What is node_modules?Is it a good idea to push that on git?
->node_modules can be thought of as a cache maintained to keep all the external packages used by our application.
Node.js is trained to look for these packages inside node_modules,
when we import those packages in any file in our app.

13.What is the dist folder?
->dist folder contains the minimized version of source code
Code present in the dist folder is the actual code used in production web application.

14.What is browserlists?
->It is a tool that allows specify which browsers should be supported in your frontend app.
Can be configured in package.json

15.Read about different bundler:vite, webpack, parcel

16.Read about ^ - cater and ~ - tilda
~ - will update to all future patch versions without updating minor version
Eg:~1.2.3 = 1.2.3 to <1.3.0
^ - will update to all future minor/patch versions without updating major version
Eg:^2.3.4 = 2.3.4 to <3.0.0

17.Read about Script types in html(MDN Docs)
->script type attribute can have values: modules, importmap, blocking
i)If the script is Javascript code, then its encouraged that we omit the type attribute to indicate the scrit as JS only
ii)module: This value causes the code to be treated as a JavaScript module.
Unlike classic scripts, module scripts require the use of the CORS protocol for cross-origin fetching
